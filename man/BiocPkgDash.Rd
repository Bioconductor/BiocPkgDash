\description{
A dashboard for Bioconductor package maintainers to monitor the
  status of their packages. The key input to the dashboard is the email the
  maintainer uses in their package's `DESCRIPTION` file. The dashboard
  displays the badge statuses of the package in both the `release` or `devel`
  branches of Bioconductor. The status is determined by the results of the
  Bioconductor nightly builds. The dashboard also provides a visualization of
  the status of the package checks on either the `release` or `devel`
  branches of Bioconductor.
