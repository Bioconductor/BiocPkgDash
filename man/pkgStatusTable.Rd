\title{Build a table of package build statuses}
\usage{
pkgStatusTable(
  main = "maintainer@bioconductor\\\\.org",
  version = BiocManager::version(),
  status = c("OK", "WARNINGS", "ERROR", "TIMEOUT", "skipped"),
  stage = c("install", "buildsrc", "checksrc", "buildbin"),
  pkgType = c("software", "data-experiment", "workflows", "data-annotation"),
  data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{main}{character(1) The regex for searching through the Maintainer
column as obtained from \code{biocPkgList()}.}

\item{version}{character(1) the character version number
as used to access the online build report. For
example, "3.14". The default is the "current version"
as given by \code{BiocManager::version()}. Note
that this is a character vector of length one and not a number.}

\item{status}{`character()` The status of the builders to include in the
table. These values are obtained from the `result` column in
[BiocPkgTools::biocBuildReport()]. The default is all:
`c("OK", "WARNINGS", "ERROR", "TIMEOUT", "skipped")`.}

\item{stage}{`character()` A vector of the Bioconductor Build System (BBS)
stages to include in the plot. These values are obtained from the `stage`
[BiocPkgTools::biocBuildReport()]. The default is all stages:
`c("install", "buildsrc", "checksrc", "buildbin")`.}

\item{pkgType}{`character()` A vector of package types to include in the
table. These values are passed to [BiocPkgTools::biocMaintained()].
The default is all:
`c("software", "data-experiment", "workflows", "data-annotation")`.}

\item{data}{`tibble()` / `data.frame()` A data frame of maintained packages.
This is used internally to avoid repeated calls to the
[BiocPkgTools::biocMaintained()] function.}
}
\description{
This function builds a table of package build statuses for a
 given Bioconductor version and email combination. It is mainly used for the
 Bioconductor Package Dashboard.
}
\details{
Note that binary build stages for the Linux builders are marked as
  `skipped` in the table. This is because the binaries are built on GitHub
  Actions and their result are not included in the Bioconductor Build System
  (BBS) database. Provide the `data` argument to avoid recomputing the
  list of maintained packages for a given email and Bioconductor version.
  Annotation packages are not included in the table because they are not
  built regularly by the BBS.
