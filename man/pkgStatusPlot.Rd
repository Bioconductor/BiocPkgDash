\title{A Summary Plot for Package Statuses}
\usage{
pkgStatusPlot(
  version = BiocManager::version(),
  main = "maintainer@bioconductor\\\\.org",
  status = c("OK", "WARNINGS", "ERROR", "TIMEOUT", "skipped"),
  stage = c("install", "buildsrc", "checksrc", "buildbin"),
  pkgType = c("software", "data-experiment", "workflows", "data-annotation"),
  data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{version}{character(1) the character version number
as used to access the online build report. For
example, "3.14". The default is the "current version"
as given by \code{BiocManager::version()}. Note
that this is a character vector of length one and not a number.}

\item{main}{character(1) The regex for searching through the Maintainer
column as obtained from \code{biocPkgList()}.}

\item{status}{`character()` A vector of `INSTALL`, `build` and `check`
statuses to include in the plot. These values are obtained from the
`result` column in `BiocPkgTools::biocBuildReport()`. The default is all:
`c("OK", "WARNINGS", "ERROR", "TIMEOUT", "skipped")`.}

\item{stage}{`character()` A vector of the Bioconductor Build System (BBS)
stages to include in the plot. These values are obtained from the `stage`
`BiocPkgTools::biocBuildReport()`. The default is all stages:
`c("install", "buildsrc", "checksrc", "buildbin")`.}

\item{pkgType}{\code{character(1)} The type of packages for which to get build
status information for. Valid values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{software}: Software packages
\item \code{data-experiment}: Experiment data packages
\item \code{data-annotation}: Annotation data packages
\item \code{workflows}: Workflow packages
}}

\item{data}{`tibble()` / `data.frame()` A data frame of maintained packages.
This is used internally to avoid repeated calls to the
[BiocPkgTools::biocMaintained()] function.}
}
\description{
This function generates a stacked bar plot of package statuses for
a given Bioconductor version and email combination. It is mainly used
for the Bioconductor Package Dashboard.
}
\details{
Note that binary build stages for the Linux builders are not
  included in the plot. This is because the binaries are built on GitHub
  Actions and their result are not included in the Bioconductor Build System
  (BBS) database.
